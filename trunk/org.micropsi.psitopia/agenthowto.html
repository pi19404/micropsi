<h1> How to send your own agents </h1>
<br/><br/>
<a href="index.html">main page</a>
<br/><br/>
You can send your own agents to Psitopia. Any agent that runs within the MicroPsi framework and uses either
the SteamVehicle, Turtle or Omnidrive model can be sent to Psitopia.<br/><br/>
Currently, you'll have to do some configuration work to achieve this and we can't guide you through all the
possibilities. There is, however, a standard procedure to get a SteamVehicle agent with a Node net brain
(a simpleagent, for instance) to visit Psitopia:

<ul>
<li> Download and install the MicroPsi toolkit (see the <a href="http://www.cognitive-agents.org/micropsi/space/installation"> webdoc </a>) 
<li> Start and go to Window - Preferences - Micropsi - Runtime system
<li> Select a different runtime config. In the org.micropsi.core/config directory, select psitopia-client.xml
<li> Enter "psitopia" in the "Server to use" field
<li> Enter a user name you like
<li> Uncheck "Make Server available via HTTP"
<li> Restart Eclipse. Now use the toolkit as you would do it with a local system. Your agent now lives on
Psitopia!
</ul>
