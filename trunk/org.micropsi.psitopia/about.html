<h1> What is Psitopia? </h1>
<br/><br/>
<a href="index.html">main page</a>
<br/><br/>
Psitopia is an installation of MicroPsi components that allows users to send agents to a common, simulated
world on the web.<br/><br/>
Psitopia uses just the standard core components of any MicroPsi system, plus some web-application stuff.
Why are we doing this? Because we can, and because we want to show.<br/>
Now it's your turn: We are looking for skilled JavaScript programmers and world designers who want to
make Psitopia something unique. What kind of work would have to be done?
<ul>
<li> Creative: Design a large, complex, unique-looking, beautiful and dynamic world for our little steamvehicles to roam
<li> JavaScript: Implement clever ways of displaying the world in a browser. (You know Google Maps? That's how it should
look like, methinks. Even if it's not Google Maps, we need ways of displaying large worlds.)
<li> Java/JavaScript: Make Psitopia into a web application that allows people to create agents from their browsers, watch them
and see them perform in Psitopia. 
</ul>
